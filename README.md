# -JavaScript-Slot-Machine

This JavaScript Slot Machine project I've worked on simulates a slot machine game that asks the user to deposit some money and then choose how many lines they want to bet on and how much they want to bet.
The game then randomly generates a set of symbols for each row of the slot machine, and checks to see if any of the rows match up.
The game calculates the user's winnings based on the number of matching symbols and the bet amount.
If the player runs out of money or chooses to quit, the game ends. 
This code uses input validation to prevent the user from entering invalid values, such as negative numbers or non-numerical input.
Overall, this code demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and functions in JavaScript to create an interactive game.
